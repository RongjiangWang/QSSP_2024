This is the 2024 version of FORTRAN code QSSP for calculating complete synthetic seismograms of a spherical earth using the normal mode theory. In comparison with the 2020 version, it changes the input format to provide more options of source types as well as their composition.

Highlights:

(1) all-in-one code for body waves, surface waves, free oscillations, tsunami for uniform ocean, infrasound waves for a standard atmosphere and static deformation

(2) generating Greenâ€™s function database or simulating complete seismograms for any given kinematic source model

(3) hybrid algorithm (numerical integration for low frequency / small harmonic degrees and analytical propagator algorithm for high frequency / large harmonic degrees)

(4) complex frequency technique for supressing the time-domain aliasing problem

(5) differential filter technique for suppressing numerical phases

For Windows user, the executable file is provided under folder "WindowsEXE". Linux user may compile the source codes with "gfortran" via a single command like, e.g.,

~>cd .../SourceCode

~>gfortran -o qssp2024 *.f -O3

to get the excutable code qssp2024.

After start the executable code, the program ask for an input file in the ASCII format. An example input file is provided under folder "InputFile". You may change the input data included in this file for your own applications.
